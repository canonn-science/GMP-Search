Its historical significance was also enhanced when it was chosen as the final waypoint of the two sequels to the Distant Suns expedition, those being Distant Worlds 3302 (DW1), and Distant Worlds 3305 (DW2).\r\n\r\n- Link : [Distant Worlds information index & archives](https:\/\/dw2expedition.wixsite.com\/home\/info-index)\r\n\r\nThe DSS Beagle that left Pallaeni on December 16th 3300 on its journey to the far galactic rim was a stock Asp Explorer (pre-engineering era):\r\n\r\n- 3D Power Plant\r\n- 4D Thrusters\r\n- 5A FSD\r\n- 4D Life Support\r\n- 3D Power Distributor\r\n- 5D Sensors\r\n- 5C Fuel Tank\r\n- 6C Fuel Scoop\r\n- 3D Shields\r\n- 3A AFMU x 2 (offline)\r\n- 3E Cargo Rack\r\n- 1C ADS\r\n- 1C DSS\r\n\r\nApprox. jump range 34.5 LYs\r\n\r\n\r\n**OOC clarification on the naming of Beagle Point:**\r\n\r\nThe DSS Beagle was named in honour of Kamzel's pet Beagle (Jack), who passed away just prior to the Distant Suns Expedition.\r\n\r\nPlease note that the Beagle Point tourist beacon has nothing to do with how the system got its name or its historical background.

The name &quot;Cave Nebula&quot; was coined for this object by Patrick Moore, presumably derived from photographic images showing a curved arc of emission nebulosity corresponding to a cave mouth.<\/p>\n<p>The nebula is 35 ly in diameter and of muted rust and green colors. The nebula is mostly empty of systems, with a few on the outer edges. Cave Nebula is close to the Elephant's Trunk nebula, and both can be observed together in the right locations. <\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/nm6RuKll.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\" class=\"img-fluid\" title=\"enter image title here\" target=\"_blank\" \/><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/forums.frontier.co.uk\/showthread.php\/116450-Information-The-Galactic-Mapping-Project-amp-Expedition-Hub?p=5577935&amp;viewfull=1#post5577935\" target=\"_blank\">Link<\/a><\/p>"},{"id":439,"type":"planetaryNebula","name":"Dumbbell Nebula","galMapSearch":"BD+22 3878","galMapUrl":"https:\/\/www.edsm.net\/en\/system\/id\/46476\/name\/BD%2B22+3878","coordinates":[-958.21875,-71,535.5],"descriptionMardown":"![enter image description here](http:\/\/i.imgur.com\/qZUn0dGl.png \"enter image title here\")\r\n\r\nThe Dumbell Nebula (also called M27 and NGC 6853) was the first planetary nebula to be discovered.

These winds bore different characteristics and were responsible either for draughts and famines or bountiful harvests and abundancy. Consequently, Enlil was always regarded as being a bit wayward, at one time even trying to drown mankind in a great flood.\r\n\r\nThe astronomical Winds of Enlil are a wayward object, too, and a bit of a conundrum, since many characteristics associated with a 'classic' nebula seem to be missing. First, the Winds do not have a core element like a stellar corpse from which the Winds may have originated. This alone would not pose too much of an explanatory problem but the complex also barely has any massive young stars or protostar population that would hint at star formation taking or having taken place. Instead, most stars inside the complex are rather old M and K type stars that are from 1.5 to 6.8 billion years old. This may indicate that the Winds of Enlil are in fact moving through the area, presumably being [_pulled in by the Milky Way's gravity_](http:\/\/www.space.com\/34337-massive-gas-cloud-will-collide-with-milky-way-eventually-video.html). A strong indicator for this theory is the fact that the Winds seem to be compressed or flattened at the top: Dust and gas accumulate here and the Winds' movement seems to be stalled.

These winds bore different characteristics and were responsible either for draughts and famines or bountiful harvests and abundancy. Consequently, Enlil was always regarded as being a bit wayward, at one time even trying to drown mankind in a great flood.<\/p>\n<p>The astronomical Winds of Enlil are a wayward object, too, and a bit of a conundrum, since many characteristics associated with a 'classic' nebula seem to be missing. First, the Winds do not have a core element like a stellar corpse from which the Winds may have originated. This alone would not pose too much of an explanatory problem but the complex also barely has any massive young stars or protostar population that would hint at star formation taking or having taken place. Instead, most stars inside the complex are rather old M and K type stars that are from 1.5 to 6.8 billion years old. This may indicate that the Winds of Enlil are in fact moving through the area, presumably being <a href=\"http:\/\/www.space.com\/34337-massive-gas-cloud-will-collide-with-milky-way-eventually-video.html\" target=\"_blank\"><em>pulled in by the Milky Way's gravity<\/em><\/a>. A strong indicator for this theory is the fact that the Winds seem to be compressed or flattened at the top: Dust and gas accumulate here and the Winds' movement seems to be stalled. So what we see here may in fact be the formation of a dust cloud that will eventually turn into a Stellar Nursery in a couple of million years.

It's location 'above' the Pleiades and towards the California Nebula makes the Gateway an ideal spot for landfall and further exploration of the region.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/QewbPMUl.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\" class=\"img-fluid\" title=\"enter image title here\" target=\"_blank\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/CxLBHugl.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\" class=\"img-fluid\" title=\"enter image title here\" target=\"_blank\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/Tw8Omkzl.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\" class=\"img-fluid\" title=\"enter image title here\" target=\"_blank\" \/><\/p>"},{"id":787,"type":"stellarRemnant","name":"Colonia Point","galMapSearch":"Thaae Pruae AA-A h5","galMapUrl":"https:\/\/www.edsm.net\/en\/system\/id\/5420012\/name\/Thaae+Pruae+AA-A+h5","coordinates":[-8618.09375,-2936.34375,20410],"descriptionMardown":"![enter image description here](http:\/\/i.imgur.com\/huoqqlm.png?2 \"enter image title here\")\r\n\r\nBinary Wolf-Rayet star system deep below the galactic plane. \r\n\r\nThe galaxy is laid out before any pilots brave enough to visit the remote location, with the glow of the galactic plane on one side and the cold, starless void on the other.\r\n\r\nConventional Pilots are advised to make sure they have adequate jump boost material on board before attempting to explore the area ([source](https:\/\/forums.frontier.co.uk\/showthread.php\/116450-Information-The-Galactic-Mapping-Project-amp-Expedition-Hub?p=4812150&viewfull=1#post4812150)).\r\n\r\n**Nearby POI:**\r\n- Thaee Pruae OO-Q E5-0 - Neutron Star, system contains a Water Giant and a 29 earthmass Ammonia World ([source](https:\/\/trello.com\/c\/ldKDv3DK\/29-thaee-pruae-aa-a-h5-colonia-point)).\r\n- Thaae Pruae CL-Y G7 - Difficult to reach without a Fleet Carrier [Black Hole and Neutron Star system](https:\/\/cdn.discordapp.com\/attachments\/238427796186071051\/314035166454743041\/EliteDangerous64_2017-05-16_15-32-28.png) below Colonia Point, named 'Cyj' after the wife of the first pilot to visit it ([source](https:\/\/forums.frontier.co.uk\/showthread.php\/116450-Information-The-Galactic-Mapping-Project-amp-Expedition-Hub?p=5520469&viewfull=1#post5520469)).\r\n- THAAE PRUAE AA-A H4 - an O9 IIIA star system, a tempting but very hard to reach system without a Fleet Carrier.

Its central black hole, at roughly 2.6 solar masses, is the result of a supernova that occurred some 284 million years ago. This black hole is surrounded by no less than 32 stellar bodies. These include one type 3, one type 2, and two type 1 gas giants with a plethora of landable moons. The final main planet is a large icy world with a 4.20 pressure Helium atmosphere, weighing in at almost 30~ earth masses. With no light emitting star in system, the planets here are lit only by the background light of the nebula reflected from nearby stars.\r\n\r\nThe system displays a high amount of volcanism - the majority of the moons support either water or carbon dioxide geysers, no doubt caused by the immense tidal forces that many of these bodies are subjected to.

Its central black hole, at roughly 2.6 solar masses, is the result of a supernova that occurred some 284 million years ago. This black hole is surrounded by no less than 32 stellar bodies. These include one type 3, one type 2, and two type 1 gas giants with a plethora of landable moons. The final main planet is a large icy world with a 4.20 pressure Helium atmosphere, weighing in at almost 30~ earth masses. With no light emitting star in system, the planets here are lit only by the background light of the nebula reflected from nearby stars.<\/p>\n<p>The system displays a high amount of volcanism - the majority of the moons support either water or carbon dioxide geysers, no doubt caused by the immense tidal forces that many of these bodies are subjected to. This has led to many of the moons also possessing complex and deep canyon systems.

It is speculated that the Association will thus continue to exist for considerably long time.<\/p>\n<p>The Association was mapped and surveyed during the Children of Raxxla's <a href=\"http:\/\/www.childrenofraxxla.co.uk\/forum\/showthread.php?171-18-June-3303-The-Monoceros-Mission\" target=\"_blank\">Monoceros Mission<\/a> in June 3303.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/a2z6jhF.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\" class=\"img-fluid\" title=\"enter image title here\" target=\"_blank\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Reference : <a href=\"https:\/\/forums.frontier.co.uk\/showthread.php\/116450-Information-The-Galactic-Mapping-Project-amp-Expedition-Hub?p=5681241&amp;viewfull=1#post5681241\" target=\"_blank\">Link<\/a><\/p>"},{"id":1348,"type":"jumponiumRichSystem","name":"Sifou Bubble Depot","galMapSearch":"Sifou WK-I b37-1","galMapUrl":"https:\/\/www.edsm.net\/en\/system\/id\/13924018\/name\/Sifou+WK-I+b37-1","coordinates":[-5140.65625,79.46875,1020.21875],"descriptionMardown":"Green system with all jumponium materials available.\r\n\r\nReference : [Link](https:\/\/forums.frontier.co.uk\/showthread.php\/116450-Information-The-Galactic-Mapping-Project-amp-Expedition-Hub?p=5683892&viewfull=1#post5683892)","descriptionHtml":"<p>Green system with all jumponium materials available.<\/p>\n<p>Reference : <a href=\"https:\/\/forums.frontier.co.uk\/showthread.php\/116450-Information-The-Galactic-Mapping-Project-amp-Expedition-Hub?p=5683892&amp;viewfull=1#post5683892\" target=\"_blank\">Link<\/a><\/p>"},{"id":1349,"type":"jumponiumRichSystem","name":"Formidine Rift Depot","galMapSearch":"Phrio Hypa TF-L d9-0","galMapUrl":"https:\/\/www.edsm.net\/en\/system\/id\/12013021\/name\/Phrio+Hypa+TF-L+d9-0","coordinates":[-8291.15625,-99.53125,-6656.59375],"descriptionMardown":"Green system with all jumponium materials available.\r\n\r\nReference : [Link](https:\/\/forums.frontier.co.uk\/showthread.php\/116450-Information-The-Galactic-Mapping-Project-amp-Expedition-Hub?p=5684004&viewfull=1#post5684004)","descriptionHtml":"<p>Green system with all jumponium materials available.<\/p>\n<p>Reference : <a href=\"https:\/\/forums.frontier.co.uk\/showthread.php\/116450-Information-The-Galactic-Mapping-Project-amp-Expedition-Hub?p=5684004&amp;viewfull=1#post5684004\" target=\"_blank\">Link<\/a><\/p>"},{"id":1350,"type":"jumponiumRichSystem","name":"Vacuus Depot I","galMapSearch":"Dryi Aim HO-X c15-0","galMapUrl":"https:\/\/www.edsm.net\/en\/system\/id\/13930096\/name\/Dryi+Aim+HO-X+c15-0","coordinates":[-7459.25,296.78125,-9340.1875],"descriptionMardown":"Green system with all jumponium materials available.\r\n\r\nReference : [Link](https:\/\/forums.frontier.co.uk\/showthread.php\/116450-Information-The-Galactic-Mapping-Project-amp-Expedition-Hub?p=5685803&viewfull=1#post5685803)","descriptionHtml":"<p>Green system with all jumponium materials available.<\/p>\n<p>Reference : <a href=\"https:\/\/forums.frontier.co.uk\/showthread.php\/116450-Information-The-Galactic-Mapping-Project-amp-Expedition-Hub?p=5685803&amp;viewfull=1#post5685803\" target=\"_blank\">Link<\/a><\/p>"},{"id":1351,"type":"jumponiumRichSystem","name":"Colonia Depot","galMapSearch":"Eol Prou KR-L c8-10","galMapUrl":"https:\/\/www.edsm.net\/en\/system\/id\/9566740\/name\/Eol+Prou+KR-L+c8-10","coordinates":[-9627.625,-949.0625,19788.59375],"descriptionMardown":"All jumponium materials available on 3 planets.\r\n\r\nPlanet C1, C2 and C3.\r\n\r\nReference : [Link](https:\/\/forums.frontier.co.uk\/showthread.php\/116450-Information-The-Galactic-Mapping-Project-amp-Expedition-Hub?p=5695703&viewfull=1#post5695703)","descriptionHtml":"<p>All jumponium materials available on 3 planets.<\/p>\n<p>Planet C1, C2 and C3.<\/p>\n<p>Reference : <a href=\"https:\/\/forums.frontier.co.uk\/showthread.php\/116450-Information-The-Galactic-Mapping-Project-amp-Expedition-Hub?p=5695703&amp;viewfull=1#post5695703\" target=\"_blank\">Link<\/a><\/p>"},{"id":1352,"type":"nebula","name":"Skeleton Key Nebula","galMapSearch":"Dryio Gree WJ-Z e915","galMapUrl":"https:\/\/www.edsm.net\/en\/system\/id\/2790988\/name\/Dryio+Gree+WJ-Z+e915","coordinates":[-8312.65625,-339.84375,31140.5625],"descriptionMardown":"Medium-small nebula, all shades of colour between lilac, through blue and into deep purple, with a thick black key-shaped central area.

There is a clear visual relationship between the structures and the Thargoid vessels previously sighted.\r\n\r\nEven more remarkable are reports that the structures encompass large subsurface complexes, accessed via the central edifice. Drone-like machines have also been seen roving the sites.\r\n\r\nProfessor Ishmael Palin, leading authority on xeno-biological research, [has commented](https:\/\/community.elitedangerous.com\/en\/galnet\/uid\/595cb76fd1d10c3bf24bb11b) on the discovery of functional technology at the Thargoid structures.\r\n\r\n\u201cThis revelation is significant not only because it gives us an insight into Thargoid technology, but because it confirms the long-posited connection between the Thargoids and the Unknown Artefacts and Probes.

At least, not for the time being...<\/p>\n<p>Interest in Merope was renewed with the discovery of a network of Unknown Structures that also appears to form a shell-like structure around Merope. This interest has only increased with the revelation that both the unknown artifacts, ships, and structures may all be of Thargoid origin. But to this day it is still a mystery how Merope itself fits into the bigger picture.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Links:<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/forums.frontier.co.uk\/showthread.php\/355713-Alien-archeology-and-other-mysteries-Thread-10-The-Canonn\" target=\"_blank\">Canonn research into alien mysteries<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/forums.frontier.co.uk\/showthread.php\/116450-Information-The-Galactic-Mapping-Project-amp-Expedition-Hub\" target=\"_blank\">Galactic Mapping Project (updates to this entry)<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/yy8od4S.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\" class=\"img-fluid\" title=\"enter image title here\" target=\"_blank\" \/><\/p>"},{"id":1430,"type":"deepSpaceOutpost","name":"Obsidian Orbital (and other settlements in the Pleiades)","galMapSearch":"Maia","galMapUrl":"https:\/\/www.edsm.net\/en\/system\/id\/25341\/name\/Maia","coordinates":[-81.78125,-149.4375,-343.375],"descriptionMardown":"In the fall of 3301 the Explorers Association [successfully completed its campaign](https:\/\/community.elitedangerous.com\/en\/galnet\/uid\/564c4f9d9657ba475c1da88e) to establish Obsidian Orbital as the first permanent outpost in the Pleiades cluster.

The outermost B-class star revolves in a barycenter orbit with the primary and binary stars, making its orbital period a remarkable 1.6million days [4,400 years] at a distance 337,000ls from the primary star. This star contains its own collection of planets, including a Class V gas giant, the closest orbit. There is also a terraformable water world orbiting this distant star. Not for the faint of heart, this system\u2019s complexity offers a magnificent experience for all explorers willing to invest the time to uncover its majesty.<\/p>\n<p>The system is also a green system containing all jumponium materials.

From within the planetary nebula the nearby Skaudai emission nebula is clearly visible, lighting the way to Sacagawea spaceport and on to the Festival Grounds.<\/p>\n<p>Reference: <a href=\"https:\/\/forums.frontier.co.uk\/showthread.php\/116450-Information-The-Galactic-Mapping-Project-amp-Expedition-Hub?p=6722360&amp;viewfull=1#post6722360\" target=\"_blank\">Link<\/a><\/p>"},{"id":1727,"type":"historicalLocation","name":"Rekohu Project","galMapSearch":"Plaa Ain FF-Z d76","galMapUrl":"https:\/\/www.edsm.net\/en\/system\/id\/13960522\/name\/Plaa+Ain+FF-Z+d76","coordinates":[881.6875,415.03125,9257.03125],"descriptionMardown":"![enter image description here](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/t9jUHRW.png \"enter image title here\")\r\n\r\nIn April 3304 Angeli Imperial Enterprises, one of the Empire's key suppliers of foodstuffs and other consumables, constructed a Bowman class Science vessel to carry out research of the plant and animal life on the planets in the PLAA AIN region\r\n\r\nThis was part of the Rekohu Project, meaning 'Misty Skies\" in Moriori, which was to address the concerns of AIE Scientists that a majority of the crops used in the human bubble were the cultivars from stocks from Earth.\r\n\r\nThe Rekohu Project, if successful, will allow Imperial Argi-techs to increase the biodiversity of the crops used, to minimize the rise of blight or other issues ([source](https:\/\/forums.frontier.co.uk\/showthread.php\/116450-Information-The-Galactic-Mapping-Project-amp-Expedition-Hub?p=6673390&viewfull=1#post6673390)).\r\n\r\nThe Science vessel, registry RKU001, can be found moving between two Earth-like Worlds on its ongoing mission - each week alternating its location:\r\n- ELW System 1: PLAA AIN FF-Z D76 \r\n- Orbital Body: B 5 \r\n\r\n\r\n- ELW System 2: PLAA AIN KS-A B2-5\r\n- Orbital Body: A 1 \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nIn addition picturesque Fumaroles can be found at:\r\n- System: PLAA AIN FF-Z D76 \r\n- Orbital Body: A 2 C A\r\n- Coordinates: -19.2557 \/ -85.2813\r\n\r\n![enter image description here](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/UfD16DB.png \"enter image title here\")","descriptionHtml":"<p><img src=\"https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/t9jUHRW.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\" class=\"img-fluid\" title=\"enter image title here\" target=\"_blank\" \/><\/p>\n<p>In April 3304 Angeli Imperial Enterprises, one of the Empire's key suppliers of foodstuffs and other consumables, constructed a Bowman class Science vessel to carry out research of the plant and animal life on the planets in the PLAA AIN region<\/p>\n<p>This was part of the Rekohu Project, meaning 'Misty Skies&quot;

Unknown Artefacts and Unknown Probe, both of which later transpired to be of Thargoid origin, and the ruins of the ancient civilisation nicknamed the Guardians.\r\n\r\nAs investigations into these progressed, the Unknown Probe was found to reference a system within one of the mysterious permit locked regions of space; Col 70 Sector FY-N C21-3.\r\n\r\nAlthough the Col 70 Sector contained various unlocked regions which could be accessed, all systems which were part of Col 70 itself remained inaccessible, despite all efforts by independent cmdrs to find a means of entry.

Working on this principle a small survey was conducted of the Col 70 border as near as possible to FY-N C21-3 to discover candidate bodies for Braintrees.\r\n\r\nSure enough, on 27th October 3303, Braintrees were found on the first site checked, only 100ly from Col Sector FY-N C21-3.\r\n\r\nAt this point, hostile reactions from Thargoids to Guardian artefacts had already been discovered, and with a close proximity, if not overlap, between a Thargoid related system and Guardian space established, various questions were left open...\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat was the relationship between the Thargoids and Guardians?\r\n\r\nWhy was there an area in the Synuefe sector with Braintrees but no Guardian ruins? Was this a sign of a conflict with the Thargoids?\r\n\r\nWhat was in the mysterious Col Sector FY-N C21-3 system?\r\n\r\nAnd with the permit locked Regor Sector having been established as the apparent hear of the Guardian bubble, who had put in place the permit locks, and why?\r\n\r\nReference: [Link](https:\/\/forums.frontier.co.uk\/showthread.php\/116450-Information-The-Galactic-Mapping-Project-amp-Expedition-Hub?p=6766981&viewfull=1#post6766981)","descriptionHtml":"<p>A large patch of \u00b4Brain trees\u00b4 can be found at: <\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Orbital Body: AB 2a<\/li>\n<li>Coordinates: -25.006 \/ 137.887\n<hr \/><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>In the early years of the 3300s, a number of significant discoveries were made; the Unknown Artefacts and Unknown Probe, both of which later transpired to be of Thargoid origin, and the ruins of the ancient civilisation nicknamed the Guardians.<\/p>\n<p>As investigations into these progressed, the Unknown Probe was found to reference a system within one of the mysterious permit locked regions of space; Col 70 Sector FY-N C21-3.<\/p>\n<p>Although the Col 70 Sector contained various unlocked regions which could be accessed, all systems which were part of Col 70 itself remained inaccessible, despite all efforts by independent cmdrs to find a means of entry.

Working on this principle a small survey was conducted of the Col 70 border as near as possible to FY-N C21-3 to discover candidate bodies for Braintrees.<\/p>\n<p>Sure enough, on 27th October 3303, Braintrees were found on the first site checked, only 100ly from Col Sector FY-N C21-3.<\/p>\n<p>At this point, hostile reactions from Thargoids to Guardian artefacts had already been discovered, and with a close proximity, if not overlap, between a Thargoid related system and Guardian space established, various questions were left open...<\/p>\n<p>What was the relationship between the Thargoids and Guardians?<\/p>\n<p>Why was there an area in the Synuefe sector with Braintrees but no Guardian ruins? Was this a sign of a conflict with the Thargoids?<\/p>\n<p>What was in the mysterious Col Sector FY-N C21-3 system?<\/p>\n<p>And with the permit locked Regor Sector having been established as the apparent hear of the Guardian bubble, who had put in place the permit locks, and why?<\/p>\n<p>Reference: <a href=\"https:\/\/forums.frontier.co.uk\/showthread.php\/116450-Information-The-Galactic-Mapping-Project-amp-Expedition-Hub?p=6766981&amp;viewfull=1#post6766981\" target=\"_blank\">Link<\/a><\/p>"},{"id":1737,"type":"minorPOI","name":"Ewoks Rest","galMapSearch":"Clookia NK-M d8-431","galMapUrl":"https:\/\/www.edsm.net\/en\/system\/id\/25726165\/name\/Clookia+NK-M+d8-431","coordinates":[-3745.8125,-305.9375,12472.125],"descriptionMardown":"![enter image description here](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/LUZ303N.png \"enter image title here\")\r\n\r\nEarth Like Moon orbiting a gas giant in a tidally locked orbit of 1.5 days.

It was discovered by French astronomer Pierre M\u00e9chain on February 16, 1781. When William Parsons, 3rd Earl of Rosse, observed the nebula in 1848, his hand-drawn illustration resembled an owl's head. It has been known as the Owl Nebula ever since.\r\n\r\nThe nebula is approximately 8,000 years old. It is approximately circular in cross-section with a little visible internal structure.

It was discovered by French astronomer Pierre M\u00e9chain on February 16, 1781. When William Parsons, 3rd Earl of Rosse, observed the nebula in 1848, his hand-drawn illustration resembled an owl's head. It has been known as the Owl Nebula ever since.<\/p>\n<p>The nebula is approximately 8,000 years old. It is approximately circular in cross-section with a little visible internal structure.

On top of that, planet's surface layer is slippery ice, so SRV grip is very weak, which not only greatly increases breaking distance, but in combination with high gravity can lead to inability of getting out of deep and steep ravines. All commanders are strongly recommended to depend on their sensors during landing and be extremely cautious if they decide to leave the ship (<a href=\"https:\/\/forums.frontier.co.uk\/threads\/information-the-galactic-mapping-project-expedition-hub.116450\/post-7904068\" target=\"_blank\">source<\/a>).<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/ypxnZP5.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\" class=\"img-fluid\" title=\"enter image title here\" target=\"_blank\" \/><\/p>"},{"id":1991,"type":"stellarRemnant","name":"Sheol","galMapSearch":"Nyeakue AA-A h31","galMapUrl":"https:\/\/www.edsm.net\/en\/system\/id\/2280717\/name\/Nyeakue+AA-A+h31","coordinates":[14771.6875,-267.375,6769.25],"descriptionMardown":"![enter image description here](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/GNquVlW.png \"enter image title here\")\r\n\r\nThis system is full of death - stellar death, to be exact.

Also unexplained are the unusually large masses on the rocky worlds, such as the 36 earth-mass ammonia world; and the strangely small gas giants, such as the tiny Water Giant of only 30.3 solar masses and nearly the same radius as the ammonia world.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/qsN3URcl.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\" class=\"img-fluid\" title=\"enter image title here\" target=\"_blank\" \/><\/p>"},{"id":2051,"type":"planetFeatures","name":"Lyaisoo Black Earth","galMapSearch":"Lyaisoo AA-A h447","galMapUrl":"https:\/\/www.edsm.net\/en\/system\/id\/45083383\/name\/Lyaisoo+AA-A+h447","coordinates":[4057.71875,245.75,31293.46875],"descriptionMardown":"This is an extremely rare find: an Earth-like world orbiting a black hole.

Additional mining ops took place at [Luna's Shadow](https:\/\/www.edsm.net\/en\/galactic-mapping#6\/-1\/0\/51798|minorPOI|1889), which added a further 5,000T of fuel needed to see the Distant Worlds, Tartarus, and Zero Dawn reach their destinations deep into the Abyss.\r\n\r\nDSSA Distant Worlds visited Salome's Reach on June 20th 3306, before jumping back to Beagle Point to begin its permanent DSSA deployment.\r\n\r\nDSSA Distant Worlds was one of 11 Carriers on the Aphelion Expedition.

Voqooe BI-H d11-864 sits at the heart of a network of almost 400 Earth Like Worlds containing systems explored by pilots of the Celestial Light Brigade.

It reached it's destination of Xothae MA-A d2 on July 12th 3306.\r\n\r\nOn Monday March 28th 3308, The DSSA Chrysaetos Refuge was temporarily relieved of duty in the Xothae MA-A d2 system by the BPFC Terre de Borann captained by CMDR Eagle131. Over the next three days the Refuge made its way to Colonia briefly stopping at various Galactic Mapping Project points of interest:\r\n\r\n- Phraifaae AA-A h0 (The King and Queen of Mikenas)\r\n- Hypua Priae BA-A g0 (Mene Tekel)\r\n- Wembeau KM-V e2-12 (The Other Eye of Sauron)\r\n- Agnaimt AA-A h39 (The Three Amigos)\r\n- Agnaix QD-A d1-71 (Kraken Nebula)\r\n- Eol Prou AA-A h162 (Tartarus)\r\n\r\nOn Thursday March 31st 3308 the Refuge rendezvoused with CMDR Bob48 in orbit of the Glow Bug Gas Giant POI in the Eol Prou KW-L c8-32 system for a extremely generous Tritium refueling operation in preparation for the return trip to the Aquila's Halo region. Subsequently the Refuge made a jump to the Ratraii carrier administration system where all existing crew (with exception of the Deck Officer) decided to exercise a clause in their contracts and seek opportunities elsewhere in the galaxy. While in orbit in the Ratraii system the Refuge underwent a refit of services where the existing services of Armory, Refuel, Repair and Universal Cartographics were complimented with the addition of a Concourse Bar, Pioneer Supplies, Outfitting and Vista Genomics. Having completed introductions with various Colonia based personal equipment engineers CMDR Bow Lof Petunias boarded the Refuge to command the carrier on it's return journey to the Xothae MA-A d2 system. The Refuge returned to it's deployment location on the evening of Sunday April 3rd 3308, after only 6 days away from station, traveling a near 60Kly round trip, and was welcomed home by CMDR Eagle131.\r\n\r\nDuring the refit the Refuge received funding for a further five years of guaranteed operation without any service suspensions for it's installed services and with a continued commitment to no service tariffs ever. This funding would not have been possible without the bountiful exploration data income generated from participating in the original Canonn Challenge route. CMDR Bow Lof Petunias is delighted to be able to share in the success of the associated Chronicles One expedition with the continued funding of the DSSA Chrysaetos Refuge.\r\n\r\nThe Refuge refit would not have been possible without generosity and dedication of the following commanders:\r\n\r\n- CMDR Eagle131\r\n- CMDR Bob48\r\n- CMDR Rodnaris\r\n- CMDR Tiron\r\n\r\nThe Refuge offers a place of rest and recovery for adventurers seeking to escape the more frequented parts of the galaxy, situated in the inhospitable sparseness of the Aquila's Halo region. It is a beacon in the night beyond the Milky Way's outer arm.\r\n\r\n![enter image description here](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/QJ2taYk.png \"enter image title here\")","descriptionHtml":"<p><img src=\"https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/FSRK7Je.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\" class=\"img-fluid\" title=\"enter image title here\" target=\"_blank\" \/><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Carrier Name: DSSA Chrysaetos Refuge<\/li>\n<li>Registration: WNB-W5Z<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Carrier Class:    Nautilus Class<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>Designated Region:    Aquila's Halo<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>System:   Xothae MA-A d2<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>Commission Date (date signed up to the DSSA): April 8th 3306<\/li>\n<li>Carrier Construction Date:    June 9th 3306<\/li>\n<li>Construction Location:    Enoch Port, Agartha<\/li>\n<li>Maiden Jump(s):   BD-22 3573 for fueling (June 10th 3306)\n<ul>\n<li>Alpha Centauri for maiden voyage (June 18th 3306)<\/li>\n<\/ul><\/li>\n<li>\n<p>In-service Date (date the vessel began its DSSA service): July 12th 3306<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>Services Available:   Armory, Concourse Bar, Pioneer Supplies, Outfitting, Refuel, Repair, Universal Cartographics, Vista Genomics.\nAll installed services available all the time.

It reached it's destination of Xothae MA-A d2 on July 12th 3306.<\/p>\n<p>On Monday March 28th 3308, The DSSA Chrysaetos Refuge was temporarily relieved of duty in the Xothae MA-A d2 system by the BPFC Terre de Borann captained by CMDR Eagle131. Over the next three days the Refuge made its way to Colonia briefly stopping at various Galactic Mapping Project points of interest:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Phraifaae AA-A h0 (The King and Queen of Mikenas)<\/li>\n<li>Hypua Priae BA-A g0 (Mene Tekel)<\/li>\n<li>Wembeau KM-V e2-12 (The Other Eye of Sauron)<\/li>\n<li>Agnaimt AA-A h39 (The Three Amigos)<\/li>\n<li>Agnaix QD-A d1-71 (Kraken Nebula)<\/li>\n<li>Eol Prou AA-A h162 (Tartarus)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>On Thursday March 31st 3308 the Refuge rendezvoused with CMDR Bob48 in orbit of the Glow Bug Gas Giant POI in the Eol Prou KW-L c8-32 system for a extremely generous Tritium refueling operation in preparation for the return trip to the Aquila's Halo region. Subsequently the Refuge made a jump to the Ratraii carrier administration system where all existing crew (with exception of the Deck Officer) decided to exercise a clause in their contracts and seek opportunities elsewhere in the galaxy. While in orbit in the Ratraii system the Refuge underwent a refit of services where the existing services of Armory, Refuel, Repair and Universal Cartographics were complimented with the addition of a Concourse Bar, Pioneer Supplies, Outfitting and Vista Genomics. Having completed introductions with various Colonia based personal equipment engineers CMDR Bow Lof Petunias boarded the Refuge to command the carrier on it's return journey to the Xothae MA-A d2 system. The Refuge returned to it's deployment location on the evening of Sunday April 3rd 3308, after only 6 days away from station, traveling a near 60Kly round trip, and was welcomed home by CMDR Eagle131.<\/p>\n<p>During the refit the Refuge received funding for a further five years of guaranteed operation without any service suspensions for it's installed services and with a continued commitment to no service tariffs ever. This funding would not have been possible without the bountiful exploration data income generated from participating in the original Canonn Challenge route. CMDR Bow Lof Petunias is delighted to be able to share in the success of the associated Chronicles One expedition with the continued funding of the DSSA Chrysaetos Refuge.<\/p>\n<p>The Refuge refit would not have been possible without generosity and dedication of the following commanders:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>CMDR Eagle131<\/li>\n<li>CMDR Bob48<\/li>\n<li>CMDR Rodnaris<\/li>\n<li>CMDR Tiron<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>The Refuge offers a place of rest and recovery for adventurers seeking to escape the more frequented parts of the galaxy, situated in the inhospitable sparseness of the Aquila's Halo region. It is a beacon in the night beyond the Milky Way's outer arm.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/QJ2taYk.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\" class=\"img-fluid\" title=\"enter image title here\" target=\"_blank\" \/><\/p>"},{"id":2139,"type":"independentOutpost","name":"DSSA Erikson\u2019s Gateway","galMapSearch":"Hypoe Bloae KZ-Z c16-6","galMapUrl":"https:\/\/www.edsm.net\/en\/system\/id\/54505857\/name\/Hypoe+Bloae+KZ-Z+c16-6","coordinates":[-31101.71875,-86.4375,32944.625],"descriptionMardown":"![enter image description here](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/szlUZNX.png \"enter image title here\")\r\n\r\n- Carrier Name:\tDSSA Erikson\u2019s Gateway\r\n- Registration:\tV0Y-3QW\r\n\r\n- Carrier Class:\tNautilus Class\r\n- Designated Region:\tOuter Arm\r\n- System:\tHypoe Bloae KZ-Z c16-6\r\n\r\n- Commission Date (date signed up to the DSSA):\tApril 23th 3306\r\n- Carrier Construction Date:\tJune 14th 3306\r\n- Construction Location:\tJaques Station, Colonia\r\n- Maiden Jump(s):\tLeft Colonia (July 11th 3306)\r\n- In-service Date (date the vessel began its DSSA service):\tJuly 17, 3306\r\n- Odyssey Carrier Replacement Completed: April 9th, 3308\r\n\r\n- Services Available:\tServices Available: Repair, Refuel, Armory, Shipyard, Outfitting, Universal Cartographics, Redemption Office, Vista Genomics, Pioneer Supplies, Bar.\r\n- Tariff % Set:\t16%\r\n- Commodities Bought\/Sold on Carrier:\tBuys Tritium at varying prices Until Full.\r\nSells a small supply of alcohol for role playing purposes.\r\n- Nearest Tritium Hotspot:\tIn system (Hypoe Bloae KZ-Z c16-6)\r\n\r\nErickson\u2019s Gateway resides in the Outer Arm, to provide a waypoint between the Outer Arm and Erikson's Star, located in the Scutum-Centaurus Arm.

For a 77LY-capable ship, as used for this visit, it is highly recommended to have the capability to carry out a minimum of six standard FSD boosts and twelve basic FSD boosts in addition to the two premium FSD boosts to reach the nearest star. The star density is low in this region and careful fuel management is essential, potentially saving the need for more powerful FSD boosts.\r\n\r\nMore FSD boosting may be needed at times to traverse the tail end of the Perseus Arm, so a reserve of materials or the means to gather more is essential.\r\n\r\nThe Nyoijaa QD-K d8-0 system itself is a binary, with a G0 VAB primary and a M1 VA secondary. Only the secondary star has planets, six in total and three of the icy worlds have a single icy moon. The innermost planet is a high metal content type, the others are icy.\r\n\r\nThe most significant feature is the presence of two biological signals on the surface of the third planet.

For a 77LY-capable ship, as used for this visit, it is highly recommended to have the capability to carry out a minimum of six standard FSD boosts and twelve basic FSD boosts in addition to the two premium FSD boosts to reach the nearest star. The star density is low in this region and careful fuel management is essential, potentially saving the need for more powerful FSD boosts.<\/p>\n<p>More FSD boosting may be needed at times to traverse the tail end of the Perseus Arm, so a reserve of materials or the means to gather more is essential.<\/p>\n<p>The Nyoijaa QD-K d8-0 system itself is a binary, with a G0 VAB primary and a M1 VA secondary. Only the secondary star has planets, six in total and three of the icy worlds have a single icy moon. The innermost planet is a high metal content type, the others are icy.<\/p>\n<p>The most significant feature is the presence of two biological signals on the surface of the third planet.

The first tentative steps to investigate the Rift began in February 3301 when explorers following the mystery began heading out to the region.  By March of 3301 more organised excursions had been set up and efforts to map the region began.  Some of the first maps to be created during one such expedition - [the Daedalus mission](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/playlist?list=PLlxQlUpqv8ODPv1hJtk94KacFOJClgfeT)) - helped form the foundation of the Galactic Mapping Project and promote it to a wider audience beyond the exploration community.\r\n\r\nBy the summer of 3301 it became accepted that there were no known links between the UA's and the Formidine Rift, and both mysteries began to diverge.  The Rift mystery encompassed the travels of [Sentator Kahina Loren - aka Salom\u00e9](http:\/\/www.childrenofraxxla.co.uk\/forum\/showthread.php?8-Who-is-Senator-Kahina-Tijani-Loren-aka-Salom%E9). A persistent rumour would know that Salom\u00e9 was searching for something hidden within the Formidine Rift - and the words of those in the know where to \"take a line from Reorte to Riedquat... and keep going\". This re-sparked interest in the Rift mystery, and many pilots from all parts of human space embarked on a quest to uncover the truths that lay out there.\r\n\r\nThe term \"Rifter\" was gradually adopted by explorers who banded together to [jointly survey](https:\/\/docs.google.com\/spreadsheets\/d\/1aymsBbAiNF6jjoAPDzA2jWwi7FDx8ev5sk18P3YMt74\/edit?usp=sharing) the Rift and who chose to pursue the Rift mystery over others that were prominent at the time, and more organised groups emerged - most notably [The Children of Raxxla](http:\/\/childrenofraxxla.co.uk\/home\/), a group made up of dedicated Rifters who had followed the mystery from its earliest days.  Indeed, CoR were adopted by Salom\u00e9 herself and she often tasked CoR and the Rifters to search the region for clues. \r\n\r\n\r\nAs interest in the Formidine Rift developed, initiatives to set up [listening posts](http:\/\/www.childrenofraxxla.co.uk\/forum\/showthread.php?27-6-April-3302-Special-Directive-1-issued-by-Salom%E9) and patrol zones along the regions borders were instigated by Salom\u00e9, and by August of 3302 a major [Formidine Rift Expedition](https:\/\/forums.frontier.co.uk\/showthread.php\/281088-The-Formidine-Rift-Expedition-3302) got underway that concentrated its efforts on a specific sector within the Formidine Rift - the EAFOTS sector.   This particular sector had been decoded as the target location after a [seemingly unrelated GalNet article](https:\/\/community.elitedangerous.com\/en\/galnet\/uid\/57a462879657ba967bd8f578) appeared in the summer of 3302 hinting that the sector was a place of 'interest'.  Shortly afterwards the Empire detained CMDR Salom\u00e9 on an accusation of attempted assassination of Admiral Patreus.  Many suspected that these allegations were without foundation and were simply an underhand tactic employed by the powers to silence Salom\u00e9 and put a halt to efforts to uncover the secrets of the Rift.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn October 3303 it became clear that the Federation had also taken a great interest in Formidine Rift as well as Hawking's Gap and the Scutum-Sagittarii Conflux, and a federal-backed community goal tasked the exploration community to gather as much data from these regions as possible.  The Children of Raxxla launched a [competing appeal for help](https:\/\/community.elitedangerous.com\/en\/galnet\/uid\/582dc4489657bacc7c29abb9) against the Federation with the promise to release details of all Rift findings if they prevailed in the CG against the superpower.  Many Rifters and explorers loyal to the Feds had to chose sides.  Venturing out to the three regions to gather data and further map those regions, ultimately it was CoR and its allies who prevailed in the CG and by January 3303 information regarding hidden bases in the Rift, Gap, and Conflux was [published](http:\/\/www.childrenofraxxla.co.uk\/forum\/showthread.php?33-10-January-3303-Securing-the-Truth-(CoR-discover-hidden-bases-from-CG-data)).  Data logs retrieved from the bases indicated that Salom\u00e9 had been telling the truth about a power block conspiracy to hide information from the public.\r\n\r\n\r\nConcerted efforts to search the Rift for more abandoned bases continued throughout the early part of 3303, and in April of that year another clue surfaced via GalNet - this time narrowing down the search even further.  On April 18th 3303 a specific star system deep within the Rift and just a few light years deviation off the Reorte - Riedquat line was deciphered from the [GalNet clue](http:\/\/www.childrenofraxxla.co.uk\/forum\/showthread.php?143-15-April-3303-CoR-help-solve-the-penultimate-clue-to-the-Formidine-Rift-mystery).

To the north-east the gap is walled off by the Dryman Ridge. To the west the Gap gradually narrows towards the Scutum-Sagittarii Conflux, and this part of the gap are called the Lin-Shu Hollow. \r\n\r\nThe region is relatively devoid of nebulae, with the notable exception of the Pueliae Nebula that sits like a solitary island almost exactly at the center of the Gap.\r\n\r\nThe region was named in honour of the legendary 21st century scientist, Stephen Hawking.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Hawking's or Hawkin's ?**\r\n\r\nIn the late 22nd century the IAU (International Astronomical Union), the forerunner of today's Universal Cartographics, named the region in honour of the 21st century astrophysicist; Stephen Hawking.\r\n\r\nIn 3303, data logs from several abandoned settlements from the region were retrieved that referred to the region as being called \"Hawkin's Gap\".

It is nearly ellipsoid in shape and lies below the galactic plane. For the most part the OMC is an area rich in molecules in the interstellar medium, which is a prerequisite for the formation of stars. There are also areas however, that are characterized as H II regions, areas where the heavy radiation from nearby stars split molecules into their atomic components, hence preventing star formation. This is the main reason why the OMC does not take a coherent shape but rather seems to be a patchwork of nebulae and darker regions.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn early technological astronomy these objects were thought to be independent of each other but with ever more advanced methods of surveying (especially in X-ray and infrared) it became evident that the OMC is a coherent entity and in fact one of the most active regions of star formation near Sol. The nebulae within it are merely the 'hot spots' where massive young stars illuminate the surrounding medium and thus create the beautiful shapes we see today. The darker regions scattered about are areas of very densely packed interstellar medium where active star formation is taking place. These are the cradles of protostars and in fact they already abound with T Tauri type stars.\r\n\r\n\r\n**The most prominent deep sky objects in the OMC are:**\r\n\r\n- Orion Nebula (M 42, M 43)\r\n-     Running Man Nebula (NGC 1973\/6\/7)\r\n-     Flame Nebula (NGC 2024)\r\n-     Barnard's Loop\r\n-     Horsehead Nebula (IC 434, Barnard 33)\r\n-     Lambda Orionis Cluster (Col 69)\r\n-     Orion OB1 Association ([External Link](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Orion_OB1_Association))\r\n-     Witch Head Nebula (IC 2118)* \r\n\r\n_(*) According to some scientists, the Witch Head Nebula may not be a member of the OMC in itself but rather an illuminated filament on the fringe of the Orion-Eridanus Superbubble.

It is nearly ellipsoid in shape and lies below the galactic plane. For the most part the OMC is an area rich in molecules in the interstellar medium, which is a prerequisite for the formation of stars. There are also areas however, that are characterized as H II regions, areas where the heavy radiation from nearby stars split molecules into their atomic components, hence preventing star formation. This is the main reason why the OMC does not take a coherent shape but rather seems to be a patchwork of nebulae and darker regions.<\/p>\n<p>In early technological astronomy these objects were thought to be independent of each other but with ever more advanced methods of surveying (especially in X-ray and infrared) it became evident that the OMC is a coherent entity and in fact one of the most active regions of star formation near Sol. The nebulae within it are merely the 'hot spots' where massive young stars illuminate the surrounding medium and thus create the beautiful shapes we see today. The darker regions scattered about are areas of very densely packed interstellar medium where active star formation is taking place. These are the cradles of protostars and in fact they already abound with T Tauri type stars.<\/p>\n<p><strong>The most prominent deep sky objects in the OMC are:<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Orion Nebula (M 42, M 43)<\/li>\n<li>Running Man Nebula (NGC 1973\/6\/7)<\/li>\n<li>Flame Nebula (NGC 2024)<\/li>\n<li>Barnard's Loop<\/li>\n<li>Horsehead Nebula (IC 434, Barnard 33)<\/li>\n<li>Lambda Orionis Cluster (Col 69)<\/li>\n<li>Orion OB1 Association (<a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Orion_OB1_Association\" target=\"_blank\">External Link<\/a>)<\/li>\n<li>Witch Head Nebula (IC 2118)* <\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><em>(*) According to some scientists, the Witch Head Nebula may not be a member of the OMC in itself but rather an illuminated filament on the fringe of the Orion-Eridanus Superbubble.
